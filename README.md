# networkcall-scraper
selenium experimentation

This project pulls information from the network calls that have been sent out by the user!

Dependencies: 
python
selenium
selenium-wire
webdriver-manager

If you don't have any of them (assuming you have pip, if you don't have pip, install pip), run:
pip install selenium
pip install selenium-wire
pip install webdriver-manager

Otherwise ask me for questions
