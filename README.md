# networkcall-scraper
selenium experimentation

This project pulls information from the network calls that have been sent out by the user!


Usage (either works): \
git clone (the URL for this repository) \
cd to that folder

python networkcalls.py \
python3 networkcalls.py

Dependencies:
python \
selenium \
selenium-wire \
webdriver-manager
urllib

If you don't have any of them (assuming you have pip, if you don't have pip, install pip), run:
pip install selenium \
pip install selenium-wire \
pip install webdriver-manager
pip install urllib

Otherwise ask me for questions!
